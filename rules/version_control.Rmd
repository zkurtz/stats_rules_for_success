## Rule `r rule_order$version_control`: Use version control software (git, svn, mercurial)

Version control software use cases:

- Create an easy-to-navigate history of your edits; easy to return to previous versions
- Easily share your work with the world on github.com, bitbucket.org, etc.
- Streamline collaboration with co-authors: 
    - updating your shared copy is almost as easy as 'git push'
    - semi-automatically sort things out if you both edit the same document at the same time
