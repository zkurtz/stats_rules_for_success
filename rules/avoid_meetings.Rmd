## Rule `r rule_order$avoid_meetings`: Your time is too valuable for most meetings

... possibly including this one!

For example, my meetings priorities in descending order:

- Present by invitation
- Informal lunch/coffee
- Interview: hiring or applying
- Learning by seminars, conferences
- Tradition! Team "status update" -- Use email/wiki instead
- Passive membership in professional associations -- Why? WHY?
