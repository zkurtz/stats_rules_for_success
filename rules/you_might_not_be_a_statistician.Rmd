## Rule `r rule_order$you_might_not_be_a_statistician`: You might not be a statistician

Many people think "statistician" is little more than t-tests, Chi-square tests, power calculations
\newline
\newline
Two choices: (a) teach everyone what statistician means, or (b) choose a label that people already understand
\newline
\newline
Some alternative labels:

- data scientist
- machine learning research scientist
- <subject area> quantitative analyst
