## Rule `r rule_order$automatic_hyperparameter_tuning`: Use automatic hyperparameter tuners

Recurring scenario: You repeatedly fit a model to a dataset, tweaking things until you get good results

Goal: Replace manual experimentation with automatic search. Existing tuners include

- Python: `hyperopt`, `SMAC3`, many others
- R: `mlrMBO`, `caret`

Improvements needed:

- Regularization
- Expressions of uncertainty for the selected optimum
- Diagnostics to help decide when to stop tuning
- Customization for specific models
