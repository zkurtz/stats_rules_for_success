# A statistician's 12 rules for success in industry

PLACEHOLDER REPO - CONTENT COMING SOON

This contains source code for my presentation on success in industry, including scripts to generate all figures (except for those that are screenshots).

DISCLAIMER: This presentation is a collection of minimally-researched claims based on stereotypes developed over the course of a relatively brief statistics career. Contradictions and caveats to all of the proposed rules are expected and encouraged. This is a discussion piece.

# How to compile the presentation slides

Directions here assume that

- you are familiar with R and Rstudio (specifically how to knit to pdf) and can install any missing R packages that you encounter, and
- you have cloned this repo.

To produce the slide presentation, first run `/images/education.R` to produce `/images/education.pdf`.

Then knit `2018_02_23_UPitt_Stats_Industry.Rmd` to produce `2018_02_23_UPitt_Stats_Industry.pdf`
